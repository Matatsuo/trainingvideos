page authentication - encode and escape token to prevent XSS | use salt/hash encode key the chosen password for each site, SHA? 
Sanitize passcode input and localStorage.setItem to prevent scripting attacks
set password: a encrypted encoded message which can only be decoded by having the right password - this way no one can see the real password by looking at the code

ask if they want the site to be modeled after the medi-map app or the website - pt sans or helvetica, colours, etc.
different passwords for each page

add google analytics

autoprefixer

add markdown to index page and add index page to netlfiy for customization

Backend for authentication:
	Apollo + Graph Cool for serverless (potentially added directly to Gatsby)
	Express - would host the back end on a different service - Now.sh, Heroku, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, (Firebase?) can put server on subdomain and use Netlify's proxying
	to connect the two: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/03/10/go-static-without-losing-your-server/.

CMS options:
- Headless Wordpress + Gatsby - need two domains? static hosted gatsby site queries a wordpress site
